- I went more in depth with the commands that I was using in order to clear up any confusion I had in the previous day with using commands while setting up and trying the VM Ubuntu distribution Linux terminal.
- The command pwd actually stands for “print working directory” which displays the current directory the user is in. Then I went more in-depth with the ls command which is short for “list directories”. The command ls -a lists all the directories including hidden ones starting with “.”. The command ls -l outputs a detailed list of files in a long format. The command ls -r sorts files in reverse order which is handy if the user wants to see the last files first. The user can also combine command flags using ls -la for a long detailed list of all directories and hidden files.
- Today further research cleared up the confusion for a few of the commands that I used on the previous day. Focus today was the different command functions that can be used on a single command especially ls. It was also helpful that the resource I found taught me what the commands actually mean.
