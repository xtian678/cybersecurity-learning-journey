- I downloaded and installed Oracle VirtualBox which runs VMs or Virtual Machines. Setting it up on my host PC was straightforward with little to no confusion on my end allocating the necessary resources to the Ubuntu Desktop VM
- I also ran commands in the terminal of the Ubuntu Linux VM. Running pwd seems to display the current directory and user in the terminal. The command ls seems to display the different locations in the machine such as Desktop, Documents, and Downloads equivalent to folders in Windows. The command cd when used by itself does nothing but when combined with one of the directories displayed by ls changes the current directory to the specified directory typed after cd. The command whoami displays which user you are in the terminal. The command uname -a seems to display information about the current OS in the VM like the version of Linux Ubuntu. 
- So far what’s confusing to me is how to get to certain directories correctly. The command ls displays them but for some directories to be changed to I have to use the forward slash followed by the next directory. As I get more familiar with the Linux VM I am aiming to get comfortable working with the various commands in the terminal.
